public class Vehicle { // parent class ? or a child class ?
}

// Since, there is no other class to relate this class to,
// we cannot say right now that whether this class is a parent class
// or a child class.

// This class will only become a parent class when it has a child class!

// Right now, this is just a simple definition class. okay?
