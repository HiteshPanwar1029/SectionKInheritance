// Vehicle class is the parent class of FourWheeler class.
// Now, the Vehicle class has become the parent class, and
// the FourWheeler class has become the child class. ok?

// In this example, we can see, that there is a single parent class,
// called the Vehicle class and there is a single child class
// called the FourWheeler class.
// This is an example of Single (Simple) Inheritance.
